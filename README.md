# OS4_Tests
Tests for the fourth project for Operating Systems MIMUW Course.

## Available tests
* **simple_api** - simple tests for API compliance.
* **complex_api** - additional tests for API compliance.

## Running tests
To run tests, just run ./run_tests.sh on MINIX.

## Adding own tests
Script compiles and executes every C file available in directories listed in tests.txt
I am going to add more advanced tests, but if you want to add more tests to this repository, contact me.
